<p>To facilitate testing and verification, this guide includes test bundles for a number of sample patients, covering a range of measures.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Network – Practitioners, Locations, and Organizations common to test bundles</li>
	<li>Patient – Patient profiles common to test bundles</li>
	<li>Encounters – Bundles simulating patient encounters with providers over time</li>
</ul>

<p>The Network and Patient bundles are identified at the top. The remaining bundles are all grouped by encounter and represent the histories of various test patients, with a Guid as their titles.</p>
